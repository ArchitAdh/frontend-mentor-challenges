# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository contains a collection of frontend projects built while working through challenges from **Frontend Mentor**.  
Each project is based on a provided design and brief, with the goal of translating static designs into responsive, accessible, and well-structured web pages using core frontend technologies.

These projects were created as hands-on practice to strengthen fundamentals like layout, responsiveness, styling, and attention to detail.
